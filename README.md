# Party Like It's 1999!
> Feeling nostalgic about the 90s? Test your music knowledge here! 

https://ersjava.github.io/party_like_its_1999/

An interactive web browser game that dynamically displays the HTML with the jQuery library and pulls data from multiple APIs.

## How It Works

### Game Instructions
* A timer will begin and lyrics of a song that existed in 1999 will begin to display on the screen.

* The user will try and guess the title of the song and submit their answer in the box below.

* The quicker the response the more points the user will receive.

* Guessing correctly will unlock the information page with the music video, full song and lyrics, and photos of the Artist/Band. 

### Lifelines
The user will be given 3 lifelines as hints in the form of **artist name**, **song genre** and **album cover**.

The user's lifelines will disappear after use and timer will not stop while viewing the hint.
